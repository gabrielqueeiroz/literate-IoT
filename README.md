# literate-IoT
## This repository has a few jobs I've done related to IoT:
<ul>
  <li><b>blinkLed:</b> A simple program using Python, it blinks four LEDs in binary counting, the GPIOs used can be seen on the code. The code was uploaded on Raspberry Pi 3.</li>
  <li><b>bme280_mqtt:</b> A script written on Arduino IDE. Using the ESP32 microcontroller, and BME280 sensor, the code is able to simulate the behavior of a meteorology center, capturing data about temperature, humidity and pressure, and publish the information using MQTT. This was a project to explore softwares SCADA.</li>
</ul>
